# Libra
“Libra” is a two-dimensional, top-down tank shooter game with twin-stick controls, created using my C++ game engine. The game features 3 distinct levels. Players must navigate these levels, tactically evading and eliminating four types of AI enemies, each equipped with their own unique abilities.
